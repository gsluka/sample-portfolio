# Prompts Used

1.  I want you to help me create a Music Portfolio static website that will be hosted on GitHub Pages. I'd like it to mimic the squarespace template named "cruz". I'd like to keep the default tabs "About, Gallery, Music, Blog, and Contact. I have an empty index.html file for you to work in.
2.  Ok great. I'd like to work on the "About" section first. I'm thinking about something like this, but I'm open to your input:

    Hello there! My name is Jonathan Sluka and I'm a Senior at Plum High School. Music has been my passion for a number of years and I'm looking forward to pursuing this passion at the collegiate level.

    This is my personal music portfolio, where I plan on sharing my: performances, favorite bands, and my ever-expanding music gear collection.
3.  Not bad so far. I'd like to make one more change tonight. I want to replace the "Gallery" section with one called "My Gear". I have to files saved in the images folder that I'd like posted in that "My Gear" section. These two files are just tests; I plan on having maybe 5-10 total pictures for this section eventually
4.  Ok one final task for tonight. I created a new blank file for you at the root of the repo named 'prompts_used.md'. I'd like you to keep track of all of the prompts that I asked you so far during this project. They should be written using full markdown syntax.
5.  One more change for tonight. Those two pictures under the 'my gear' section are not in a viewable ratio. Here is the metadata for the images: 12.2MP, 3024 × 4032, Ultra HDR
6. Please review my entire index.html file again, I made some manual changes without your assistance. My goal right now is to update that "Blog" section. Right now, it consists of:

Studio Sessions
An inside look at the making of our new album. We spent countless hours perfecting each track, and we can't wait for you to hear it.

I want to replace "Studio Sessions" with "Having Fun". Then replace "An inside look at the making of our new album. We spent countless hours perfecting each track, and we can't wait for you to hear it." with this "Just me messing around in the basement playing some of my favorite songs." Below that, I want to embed the following Youtube videos:

7. Please center justify the text in the Blog > Having Fun section
8. Please rename the "About" tab to "About Me"
