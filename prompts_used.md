# Prompts Used

1.  I want you to help me create a Music Portfolio static website that will be hosted on GitHub Pages. I'd like it to mimic the squarespace template named "cruz". I'd like to keep the default tabs "About, Gallery, Music, Blog, and Contact. I have an empty index.html file for you to work in.
2.  Ok great. I'd like to work on the "About" section first. I'm thinking about something like this, but I'm open to your input:

    Hello there! My name is Jonathan Sluka and I'm a Senior at Plum High School. Music has been my passion for a number of years and I'm looking forward to pursuing this passion at the collegiate level.

    This is my personal music portfolio, where I plan on sharing my: performances, favorite bands, and my ever-expanding music gear collection.
3.  Not bad so far. I'd like to make one more change tonight. I want to replace the "Gallery" section with one called "My Gear". I have to files saved in the images folder that I'd like posted in that "My Gear" section. These two files are just tests; I plan on having maybe 5-10 total pictures for this section eventually
4.  Ok one final task for tonight. I created a new blank file for you at the root of the repo named 'prompts_used.md'. I'd like you to keep track of all of the prompts that I asked you so far during this project. They should be written using full markdown syntax.
